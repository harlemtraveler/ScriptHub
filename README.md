ScriptHub allows DevOps engineers to advertise jobs or take on micro-contracts, allowing for focus on core responsibilities. Have the power of an entire team at the fraction of the cost.</p>

<h3>Blockchain:</h3>
<p>Blockchain will be used to enable secure data transactions for micro-contracts. It will also be utilized for smart contracts, to manage access for leased material/data.</p>
